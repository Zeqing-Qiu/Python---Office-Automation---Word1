# Python---Office-Automation---Word1
Using Python for Office Automation, Part 2 of Word.

Situation introduction:
The company recruited a new batch of interns, to do dozens of internship contracts. I spent most of the day finishing the contract and showed it to my boss, who was not satisfied with it: "Our company's internship contract template has been updated, you didn't just know? Go back and redo it." I compared the latest document template and shed two row tears.  

You can practice with the documentation here if you want, and I've attached a reference code for you to look at. This exercise is from shanbay programming, and I've only made a few improvment to the code and added some comments. The original website was: https://web.shanbay.com/codetime/home/lessons-new/bicec.
